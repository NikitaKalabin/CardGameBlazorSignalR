## Peculiar Properties of the Game
- Real-time Communication:  
SignalR: The game leverages SignalR for real-time communication between the server and clients. This allows for instant updates and interactions, ensuring that players see the results of their actions immediately. SignalR handles the complexities of managing WebSocket connections, providing a seamless experience.
Component-based Architecture:  
- Blazor: The game is built using Blazor, a framework for building interactive web UIs with C#. Blazor allows developers to create reusable components, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. Each part of the game, such as the playing cards, game board, and score display, can be encapsulated in its own component.
- Server-side and Client-side Blazor:  
The game can be implemented using either Blazor Server or Blazor WebAssembly. Blazor Server provides a fast loading time and smaller payloads, as the application runs on the server. Blazor WebAssembly allows the game to run entirely in the browser, providing a more responsive experience.
- State Management:
C#: Using C# for both client-side and server-side logic allows for consistent state management. The game state, including player hands, scores, and game progress, can be managed efficiently using C# classes and data structures.
- Seamless Integration:  
ASP.NET Core: The game integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core, allowing for robust backend services, authentication, and data storage. This integration ensures that the game can handle multiple players, store game history, and provide secure access.
- Cross-platform Compatibility:  
.NET: The use of .NET technologies ensures that the game can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform compatibility makes the game accessible to a wider audience.
